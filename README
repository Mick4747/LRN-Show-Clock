LRN Show Clock was developed in Java 7 using the Swing library as well as 
the open-source Quartz Job Scheduling Library version 2.2.1 (www.quartz-scheduler.org)

The freeware font used for the countdown animation is Crystal by Allen R. Walden
(http://www.fontspace.com/allen-r-walden/crystal)

LRN Show Clock is a program for displaying a countdown timer at the beginning and
end of commercial breaks for any show running on the Liberty Radio Network schedule
(http://www.freetalklive.com/files/FTL_Clock.pdf). The countdown starts at 15 seconds
from the end of the commercial break and 60 seconds from the beginning. The numbers 
appear in green until the timer reaches 5 seconds, at which point they appear in red.

The program includes a GUI settings menu for users to input their showtimes. Program
will run in the background until the appointed showtime, at which point the countdown
animations will begin appearing at their proper times. Showtimes can be set for multiple
days per week, and for different time slots on different days. Program must be running 
before the beginning of the next showtime in order to work properly during that showtime.

Installation:
Unzip all contents of the .zip file to the preferred directory. To run the program, double
click the executable .jar file, LRN_Show_Clock.jar. The user can make a shortcut to the .jar
file, but the original file must be kept in the same directory as the lib folder, as it
needs access to the third-party .jars in that folder.
